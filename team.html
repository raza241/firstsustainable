                   <h3> Chief Executive Officer</h3>
                   <p>As founder and chief executive of First Sustainable, Dr. Sidell focuses largely on conceiving and implementing solutions to impose proven ABS specialty finance tools, within the context of sustainable and social impact transactions.

He simultaneously concentrates on assembling all the necessary enhancements and structures to successfully exploit such transactions.  Prior to founding First Sustainable, he spent 20 years as a quantitative, institutional debt arbitrage trader and the following seven as Chief Executive of a specialty finance company that he started at Millennium Partners.  Dr. Sidell was instrumental in arranging the sale of the company at the end of 2006. He has been involved in the sale of three companies, including the sale in 1997 to a publicly traded company of a non-toxic clothes cleaner he organized and financed.  Dr. Sidell has worked in fixed income arbitrage for several  large institutions including Chase Manhattan Bank, Chemical Bank, Societe Generale,  Greenwich Capital Markets (now RBS) and Millennium Partners.  He received his Ph.D. and M.A. from Cornell University, and BA from Boston College.  He attended Harvard University as an Exchange Scholar in the Department of Economics.  He is the author of several books and academic articles related to global finance. </p>
